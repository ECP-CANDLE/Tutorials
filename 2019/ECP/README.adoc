= CANDLE Tutorial

At ECP 2019.

== Agenda

Abstract: CANDLE (CANcer Distributed Learning Environment) is an environment designed for scalable execution of deep neural network codes. Developed initially to address three top challenges facing the cancer community, CANDLE increasingly can be used to tackle deep learning problems of other application areas. This workshop will provide a forum for hands-on tutorials on preparing a deep neural network to run in CANDLE, hyperparameter optimization, model ensembles for uncertainty quantification (UQ), and data parallelism.
